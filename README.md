## ToDo or to *not* do

Here are some points that crossed my mind, they aren't a roadmap yet nice things to have. If I will have time and *patience* I will implement them.

* Started implementing loggin, then stopped. Should defentively complete it and output it to a file if things go nuts.
* Error handling, as of now all the code runs as an ignorant. I've escaped `_` all the err ^^
* If statement to check if the file is with or without comments, line 23 or line 48 to read? Maybe is there an even better way to fetch the infos I want?
* Make special case for mushroom biomes? Color them by shades of purple instead of shades of the group temperature.

## Must do

* Learn how VSCode debugging and logging works D:
